# ActivityPub Server

A proof-of-concept for an ActivityPub server that can create and persist Actors, create and deliver Statuses for those Actors, and also create Likes (AKA Favorites) and Announcements (AKA Reblogs AKA Boosts AKA Retweets) for other Statuses elsewhere on the internet (AKA The Fediverse).

## Starting the server

If you're starting from scratch, install all the dependencies first:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Then you're ready for this:

```
bundle exec unicorn
```

The server will start running on port 8080, and you're ready to expose it to the web with something like nginx. Describing that process is outside of the scope of this readme, but [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-rails-app-with-unicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04#install-and-configure-nginx) should get you going in the right direction.

## Creating an Account

Thereâ€™s a command line script for this:

```
rake accounts:create -- --username john --display-name "John Holdun" --summary "Greetings from me!" --icon-url "https://johnholdun.com/images/bookworm-full.png"
```

Fill in your own options to create a new account on your server. The icon needs to already exist at the URL you specify; this server does not handle media uploads.

There are similar tasks for other actions you can perform on behalf of accounts on your server:

```
favorites:create
favorites:delete
follows:create
follows:delete
reblogs:create
reblogs:delete
statuses:create
statuses:delete
```

Run any of these with the `--help` flag to see the options it accepts:

```
rake favorites:create -- --help
```

## Acknowledgements

This codebase started as a fork of [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/), which I stripped away line by line to learn how the ActivityPub spec works in practice. Thanks to Eugen and everyone else that has worked on that project!
