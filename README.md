# ActivityPub Server

A proof-of-concept for an ActivityPub server that can create and persist Actors, create and deliver Statuses for those Actors, and also create Likes (AKA Favorites) and Announcements (AKA Reblogs AKA Boosts AKA Retweets) for other Statuses elsewhere on the internet (AKA The Fediverse).

## Starting the server

If you're starting from scratch, install all the dependencies first:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Then you're ready for this:

```
bundle exec unicorn
```

The server will start running on port 8080, and you're ready to expose it to the web with something like nginx. Describing that process is outside of the scope of this readme, but [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-rails-app-with-unicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04#install-and-configure-nginx) should get you going in the right direction.

## Creating an Account

Thereâ€™s a command line script for this:

```
rake accounts:create -- --username john --display-name "John Holdun" --summary "Greetings from me" --icon-url "https://johnholdun.com/images/bookworm-full.png"
```

Fill in your own options to create a new account on your server. The icon needs to already exist at the URL you specify; this server does not handle media uploads.

There are similar tasks for other actions you can perform on behalf of accounts on your server:

```
favorites:create
favorites:delete
follows:create
follows:delete
reblogs:create
reblogs:delete
statuses:create
statuses:delete
```

Run any of these with the `--help` flag to see the options it accepts:

```
rake favorites:create -- --help
```

## Adding to the Outbox

Following the standard ActivityPub flow, you can create Notes, Like Objects, and more:

```
curl -i -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer exampletoken" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"type":"Like","object":"https://mastodon.social/users/johnholdun/statuses/1508775"}' https://johnholdun.localtunnel.me/users/john/outbox
```

If the request works, you'll receive a 201 with a Location header that directs you to your created Activity. In order to deliver this Activity to the relevant parties, you'll need to run the outbox queue.

## The Queue

The inbox flow for this project is designed to be minimally process-intensive. Any request to an inbox URL will be accepted and written to the `inbox` directory without being parsed. A second process will parse these items one at a time, in the order they were received, saving statuses, accepting follows, and dispatching notifications as appropriate. You can run the parser like so:

```
ruby -e "require './environment'; ParseInboxItem.call"
```

This command will parse the oldest inbox item, delete the file, and exit. If there is a problem parsing the file, it will be moved to the `inbox-errors` directory with error data appended. There's no built-in mechanism for running this parser continuously yet, but a frequent cron job might do the trick. You might also want to run this task in a batch; it will return silently if there is nothing new to parse.

There's another process for delivering activities that are added to your local outbox. You can have this clear out a batch of outbox items in a similar way to the inbox queue:

```
ruby -e "require './environment'; ActivityDeliverer.call"
```

## To Do

### Static content

The POST /inbox requests _may_ be the most heavily-used routes (which is why they are designed the way they are, to reduce processing time), but GETs require little to no logic. To make this app as performant as possible, I want most GET requests to return static data (i.e. pre-generated JSON files). The biggest piece of work here involves creating slices of feeds that are suitable for pagination.

### Authentication

Any outbox POST is just checked against a static string right now. I think adopting [IndieLogin](https://indielogin.com/) makes sense here.

## Acknowledgements

This codebase started as a fork of [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/), which I stripped away line by line to learn how the ActivityPub spec works in practice. It's changed and expanded a lot since then, but I wanted to thank Gargron and everyone else that has worked on that project for pointing me in the right direction!
